<h1>ImageJ plugins::Orientation measurement</h1>

This plugin uses statistics to calculate an orientation vector
for each label (segment) in the image. 
This vector describes the direction (orientation) of the segment.
Stacks are considered 3D images. 
A plot of the orientation vectors is shown.

<h2>Example output</h2>
<pre>
Results of orientation analysis of image fibers149-01.jpg:

Class 44 has orientation : -0.10987, 0.99395
Class 45 has orientation : -0.37344, 0.92765
Class 46 has orientation : -0.14266, 0.98977
Class 47 has orientation : 0.95784, -0.28731

<h2>How to install</h2>
Download the plugin and copy it to your ImageJ plugin directory.
Java 1.5 or later is required to use the plugin.

<h2>Theory of operation</h2>
Calculates the orientation of all labels (intensity values) in the image
by finding the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of
the covariance matrix of the x,y,z coordinates of each label.
For the mathematical details, see <a href="http://www.pvv.org/~perchrh/papers/mastersthesisHendenBacheWiig.pdf">this paper</a> pages 31-32 (23-24).
<br>
<a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">Jama</a> (Java matrix package, public domain) is used for extracting the 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the covariance matrix. 
The vectors are normalized before printed. 
<br>
The coordinate system of the image is used. That means (x=0,y=0) is at the topmost left corner of the screen. X-coordinates increase towards the right and y-coordinates increase downwards. Z-coordinates increase into the screen.

<br>
The image is read only once. The complexity of the algorithm 
is O(N), where N is the number of pixels in the image.
